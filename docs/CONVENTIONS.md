# Conventions

Code and workflow rules that any contributor (agent or human) should follow when changing this repo. The architectural shape lives in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); this file is the changeable how-we-do-things layer.

Each rule has a **Why** (the incident or constraint behind it) so edge cases can be judged rather than blindly followed.

## Code

### CLI modules — one file per command, `python -m` invocation

Each command is its own module in `fuel_signal/` with a `@click.command` named `main` and an `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` block. Invoke as `uv run python -m fuel_signal.<module>`. See [AGENTS.md § CLI pattern](../AGENTS.md#cli-pattern) for the full list.

Do **not** add new commands to a shared CLI group, and do **not** add `[project.scripts]` entries in `pyproject.toml`.

**Why:** `[project.scripts]` entry points rely on `.pth` files for editable installs, which broke under Python 3.14. The `python -m` pattern bypasses this entirely.

### SQL strings — plain literals use `%`, not `%%`

In `db.py`, SQL is built with plain string literals (not f-strings, not `str % args` formatting). In that context `%` is a literal character — write `(p.price_date/100)%100`, not `%%100`.

**Why:** `coverage_matrix` originally had `%%100` in a plain string, which passed two literal `%` characters to SQLite and caused `OperationalError: near "%": syntax error`. Only escape to `%%` inside f-strings or `str % (args,)` formatting calls.

### Comments document intent, not behaviour

Add a one-line comment when an invariant is non-obvious (e.g. why the YYYY-DD-MM date-swap condition skips the equality case in `history.py`). Don't restate what the code already says.

## Tests

### DB fixture and CliRunner pattern

See [AGENTS.md § Test patterns](../AGENTS.md#test-patterns) for the standard `conn` fixture and `CliRunner().invoke(main, [...])` pattern for module tests.

### Time-window tests use today-relative dates

Any test that feeds data into a function with a rolling window filter (e.g. `coverage_matrix(months=24)`, `gradient_by_lga`) must compute its test dates from `datetime.date.today()`, not hardcode `"2024-01-10"`.

**Why:** `test_coverage_matrix_returns_station_month_counts` originally inserted `"2024-01-10"` data; once the 24-month window passed that date, the test silently asserted on empty results instead of failing loudly. Hardcoded dates rot.

## Definition of done

Before considering a change complete, in this order:

1. **Re-read the issue** if the change closes one. Walk through the acceptance criteria / deliverables list and confirm each item is covered by the diff. Scope often drifts during implementation; the issue is the source of truth for what was promised, and the check catches gaps before review does. If something in the issue is no longer the right thing to build, say so in the PR body rather than silently dropping it.
2. **Run pre-commit checks locally:** `uv run ruff check . && uv run pytest -q`. The pre-commit hook runs the same pair, so a failing commit otherwise costs a fix-then-recommit cycle.
3. **Update README** if a user-facing command, flag, or invocation changed. The README is the first place a user looks; a stale one is actively misleading.
4. **Update tracking docs** if a module shipped or a project phase completed:
   - `PLAN_ml_signal.md` — mark items done with strikethrough + **DONE (date, PR#)**
   - `docs/STATUS.md` — current build state
   - `docs/ML_SIGNAL.md` — design decisions if any landed
5. **Commit `experiments/results.csv`** immediately after any `calibrate.py` or `score_phase2.py` run, as a standalone `chore: record experiment results` commit. The row is the permanent experiment log regardless of whether the model code survives.

## Decisions land in repo docs, not just memory

When a design decision is made during a session, capture it in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [docs/ML_SIGNAL.md](ML_SIGNAL.md), or the relevant `PLAN_*.md` — **before** the work that depends on it. Private memory files complement repo docs but never substitute for them; decisions that govern code structure must be discoverable and version-controlled.

## Git workflow

- **Fresh branch per PR.** Branch off `main` for each PR; do not continue committing to a previously merged branch even though GitHub diffs against `main` would still work.
- **Open the PR immediately** after the first commit+push — no need to ask first.
- Branch naming, PR title format, and PR body shape: see [AGENTS.md § Branch and PR conventions](../AGENTS.md#branch-and-pr-conventions).

## PR feedback loop

Immediately after `gh pr create` returns a PR number, call `ScheduleWakeup(delaySeconds=270)` with a prompt that runs `gh pr view <N> --json comments,reviewThreads`. This is a mandatory mechanical step, not a suggestion — do it before writing any response to the user. When the wakeup fires: implement appropriate review comments (use judgement on style nits that conflict with project conventions), run `uv run ruff check . && uv run pytest -q`, push, and repeat until no actionable comments remain. If no automated reviewer (e.g. CodeRabbit) has commented yet, move on — don't block on a specific tool being present.

## Code review caution

Before filing an issue from an agent-driven logic review:

- **Trace a concrete example** end-to-end, especially for format-handling code. The `history.py` YYYY-DD-MM date-swap condition was wrongly flagged because the agent didn't walk through a case where `raw_day == true_month`.
- **Check the docstring** for stated design intent before claiming inconsistency. `series.py`'s `brand:` resolver was wrongly flagged for using exact match — the docstring said exact was the intent.

## Shell tooling

Use `jq` for JSON slicing in bash, not `python3 -c "import json…"`. Idiomatic, cleaner output, no temp scripts.
